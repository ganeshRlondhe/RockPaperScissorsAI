# RockPaperScissorsAI

This project is a fun way to play Rock-Paper-Scissors using a webcam. It detects your hand gestures using computer vision and Mediapipe, recognizing whether you're showing "Rock," "Paper," or "Scissors." The program compares your move with a randomly chosen move from the computer. Based on the classic game rules, it determines the winner. A countdown timer ensures fair play, giving you time to show your gesture before the match starts. The result is displayed on the screen along with both moves. It's an interactive blend of artificial intelligence and hand tracking, turning a simple game into an engaging digital experience.
